# Marburg-Virus-VSP-Illumina-Analysis

**End-to-end bioinformatics pipeline for Marburg virus sequencing (Viral Surveillance Panel, Illumina data).**  

In November 2025, Ethiopia reported its **first outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD)** in the South Ethiopia Region. This repository provides a robust bioinformatics workflow for the **whole genome sequencing of MARV from the recent 2025 outbreak in Ethiopia**. Samples were processed at the **Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI)** in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, supporting high-quality genome assembly, sequence alignment, and phylogenetic analysis.

The pipeline utilizes the **Illumina Viral Surveillance Panel (VSP) v2 Kit**, which enables reference-based genome assembly for over 200 viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, arboviruses, and hepatitis viruses. The hybrid-capture methodology of the VSP v2 Kit ensures high accuracy in mutation detection, making it highly suitable for outbreak investigations and studies of viral evolution.
